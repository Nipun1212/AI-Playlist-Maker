> The python package that returns response of [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/) through API.

![](./assets/bard_api.gif)


I referred to [this github repository(github.com/acheong08/Bard)](https://github.com/acheong08/Bard) where inference process of Bard was reverse engineered. Using `__Secure-1PSID`, you can ask questions and get answers from Google Bard. This package is designed for application to the Python package [ExceptNotifier](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/ExceptNotifier) and [Co-Coder](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Co-Coder). Please note that the bardapi is not a free service, but rather a tool provided to assist developers with testing certain functionalities due to the delayed development and release of Google Bard's API. It has been designed with a lightweight structure that can easily adapt to the emergence of an official API. Therefore, I strongly discourage using it for any other purposes.

<br>


Do not expose the `__Secure-1PSID`
> Note that while I referred to `__Secure-1PSID` value as an API KEY for convenience, it is not an officially provided API KEY.

- Helpful prompts for Google Bard

<br>

## Install
The latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:
```
pip install bardapi
```
You may instead want to use the development version from Github:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API.git
```

<br>

## Authentication
1. Visit https://bard.google.com/
2. F12 for console
3. Session: Application → Cookies → Copy the value of  `__Secure-1PSID` cookie.

<br>

## Usage 
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zzzlTIh0kt2MdjLzvXRby1rWbHzmog8t?usp=sharing) 


Simple Usage

```python
from bardapi import Bard

token = 'xxxxxxxxxx'
bard = Bard(token=token)
bard.get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']
```
Or you can use this
```python
from bardapi import Bard
import os
os.environ['_BARD_API_KEY']="xxxxxxxx"

Bard().get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']
```

To get reponse dictionary
```python
import bardapi
import os

# set your __Secure-1PSID value to key
token = 'xxxxxxxxxx'

# set your input text
input_text = "나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘"

# Send an API request and get a response.
response = bardapi.core.Bard(token).get_answer(input_text)
```



Addressing errors caused by delayed responses in environments like Google Colab and containers. If an error occurs despite following the proper procedure, utilize the timeout argument.
```python
from bardapi import Bard
import os
os.environ['_BARD_API_KEY']="xxxxxxxx"

bard = Bard(timeout=30) # Set timeout in seconds
bard.get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']
```

<br>

## Further
### Behind a proxy
If you are working behind a proxy, use the following.
```python
from bardapi import Bard
import os
os.environ['_BARD_API_KEY']="xxxxxxxx"

# Change 'http://127.0.0.1:1080' to your http proxy
# timeout in seconds
bard = Bard(proxies={'http':'http://127.0.0.1:1080', 'https':'http://127.0.0.1:1080'}, timeout=30)
bard.get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']
```

### Reusable session object
You can continue the conversation through a reusable session.
```python
from bardapi import Bard
import os
import requests
os.environ['_BARD_API_KEY'] = 'xxxxxxxxxxx'
# token='xxxxxxxxxxx'

session = requests.Session()
session.headers = {
            "Host": "bard.google.com",
            "X-Same-Domain": "1",
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.114 Safari/537.36",
            "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8",
            "Origin": "https://bard.google.com",
            "Referer": "https://bard.google.com/",
        }
session.cookies.set("__Secure-1PSID", os.getenv("_BARD_API_KEY")) 
# session.cookies.set("__Secure-1PSID", token) 

bard = Bard(session=session, timeout=30)
bard.get_answer("나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘")['content']

# Continued conversation without set new session
bard.get_answer("What is my last prompt??")['content']
```

## Translation to Another Programming Language
Please check the translation results in [this folder](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/tree/main/translate_to).
- Copy the code of [Core.py](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/bardapi/core.py).
- Ask ChatGPT to translate like "Translate to Swift."
- Ask ChatGPT to optimize the code or provide any desired instructions until you're satisfied.<br>

## Scripts
In the scripts [folder](./scripts/), I have released a script to help you compare [OpenAI-ChatGPT](./scripts/openai_api.ipynb), [Microsoft-EdgeGPT](./scripts/microsoft_api.ipynb) and [Google-Bard](./scripts/google_api.ipynb). I hope they will help more developers.

## Shifting Service Policies: Bard and Google's Dynamics 
Bard's service status and Google's API interfaces are in constant flux. *The number of replies is currently limited, but certain users,* such as those utilizing VPNs or proxy servers, have reported slightly higher message caps. Adaptability is crucial in navigating these dynamic service policies. Please note that the cookie values used in this package are not official API values.
